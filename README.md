Install with `cargo install clippit`, then in a Rust directory, run

```
cargo clippy 2>&1 | clippit
```

Only tested with `rustc 1.53.0` and `clippy 0.1.53`.

Special thanks to https://github.com/gbigwood/Clippo for the ascii art.

The current version of clippit only works with a select number of clippy rules, so please create an issue if you come
across a clippy output that could be improved (include the output of `cargo clippy 2>&1`
and `cargo clippy 2>&1 | clippit` in the issue).
